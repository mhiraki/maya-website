            <p>Aloha (hello)! I’m Maya.</p>
            <p>Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, I’m just finding my way through Washington D.C. at Georgetown University. No matter the location, I am grounded by values from my upbringing in Hawaii, Japanese-American heritage, and simplistic but vibrant aesthetic. 
            </p>
            <p>I’m continually curious about entrepreneurship, public policy, design, and social impact and how such disciplines might improve environmental sustainability and education. My passions may not take me on a straight path— but the tangential journeys are just as important.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the quote that I try to live my life by is from Maya Angelou (of course her name is Maya, too).
            </p>
            <p id="quote">“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”</p>
            <p>Aloha (also goodbye) and a hui hou (until we meet again).</p>

               <h3>RedShift</h3>
               <p>We live in a generation where careers are rapidly evolving.
It is no longer sufficient to be merely prepared for one
profession, you must be able to leverage opportunities to
build a fulfilling and sustainable professional life. While
this future may signal freedom from isolated disciplines and
enhanced career mobility, it uniquely challenges communities
with little access to baseline opportunities. Members
of low-income communities can see the national progress
around them, but are not given the tools to apply those
developments in their communities. We think it’s time that
members of disadvantaged communities get a piece of the action... </p>

               <h3>Students for a Creative Campus</h3>
               <p>Over the past few years, the opportunities for creative work
and education at Georgetown have expanded rapidly. There
is no single department responsible for delivering these
opportunities. Instead, they are made possible by a distributed
network of university programs, units, and initiatives
.</p>
<p>As a result, students are increasingly engaging in creative
learning experiences that span the domains of entrepreneurship,
design, communication, technology, policy, making
and craftwork, social impact, and more.</p>
<p>Today these opportunities continue to grow, supported by
many faculty, students, administrators, donors, and partners
outside of the university community. But if creativity
is going to truly flourish at Georgetown, we need to ensure
that it has the space to do so...</p>

               <p>Through Innovo Consulting, a McDonough School of Business affiliated club at Georgetown University, I consulted for Sustainable Innovations, a NGO that focused on creating rainwater harvesting systems in rural Rajasthan, India. This is the work that my team and I researched to provide the organization with information to use for informational materials.</p>
